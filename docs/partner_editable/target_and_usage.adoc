This Quick Start is for users who want to deploy ZebClient in AWS Azure. Please contact Zebware for OnPrem or Hybrid mode installations. The installation of a cluster is automated with some basic configuration command like wanted performance and redudancy level called Cluster nodes.

Installation started in a Zebware Store to get a trial licese key for ZebClient, compute node provide, and selection of performance and redundancy level. Zebware Store provides a download link to ZebClient CLI. Once installed in Linux, MacOS or Windows the configuration can start via ZebClient-Interactive. Login with the choosen access credentials (email-address and password) in the Zebware Store. Follow the deployment wizard and answer a few questions. A summery of the choosen configuration will be presened before deployment starts. It takes about 15-30 minutes to complete the deployment and an email will be sent to the IAM-user that was created in ZebClient-Interactive when the deployment is completed.

Download the SSH key (Id_rsa) from Zebclient-Interactive and the Inventory file to get the IP-address to the Agents that provide S3 / File System access to ZebClient.
