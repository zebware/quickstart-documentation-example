When deploying this Quick Start, a ZebClient environment is installed in the AWS Cloud by use of a new virtual private cloud (VPC).

Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for ZebClient on AWS.

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

1. The ZebClient CLI (Command Line Interface) interacts with ZebClient Manager and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The ZebClient CLI configures ZebClient and creates, updates, or removes a cluster.

2. When provided as SaaS, ZebClient Manager is ready for service in a multi-tenant way.

3. Optionally, ZebClient Manager can be installed in a VPC with a single command in ZebClient CLI.

4. Configure & Deploy starts when the ZebClient CLI configuration is completed, and the admin agrees to deploy.

5. ZebClient application nodes serve any type of application that communicates via file interface or S3. In ZebClient we refer to the ultra-fast application nodes as a hot tier because only data that is actively used is available in this layer.

6. The ZebClient warm tier cluster nodes provide redundancy and accessibility to data. The warm tier provides fast delivery of data when requested by the hot tier. Each ZebClient package uses a selected configuration of the warm tier to best fit the requirements of the application using ZebClient.

7. The ZebClient S3 storage is a cold tier holding data at rest. The cold storage does however keep and securely store the latest version of any data.

8. Software applications can be installed locally or in a virtual desktop and connect to ZebClient via S3 or file interface. Choose between Windows or Linux as operating system for Virtual Desktop. A high-performance GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) can be added for graphical design, rendering or gaming use cases.

In private subnets:

ZebClient can be deployed on-prem or in a hybrid-cloud solution combining on-prem and AWS cloud resources. Please contact Zebware for on-prem or hybrid-cloud deployments, to secure the best design and to enable a safe deployment on-prem where outside access from the AWS cloud needs to be allowed.
