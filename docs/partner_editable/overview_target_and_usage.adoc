* This Quick Start is targeting users who want to deploy ZebClient in AWS Cloud. Please contact mailto:info@zebware.com[Zebware] for on-prem or hybrid-cloud installations.

* To initiate a deployment of ZebClient, go to the Zebware Store to order a ZebClient trial license.  ZebClient is offered in pre-defined packages which include an automated deployment of cloud compute and storage resources using customersâ€™ own cloud credentials.  Via the Zebware Store, a link is provided to download the ZebClient CLI. Once installed on Linux, MacOS or Windows, the configuration of resources used for ZebClient can start via the ZebClient CLI. A customer login with the chosen access credentials (email-address and password) is also created via the Zebware Store. Follow the deployment wizard and answer the questions to complete the deployment. The deployment process takes about 15-30 minutes to complete.
