To verify that the proper ZebClient package and/or cluster size  are selected to fit your specific use case, a moderate to substantial experience of DevOps tasks and design work is recommended. +

This Quick Start also assumes familiarity with basic terminal window commands. +

* ZebClient is designed to make deployments as smooth as possible. Using the ZebClient Manager tool, configurations of ZebClient and the creation, updates and removal of AWS clusters used for the ZebClient deployment are all automated.

* To access the configuration and deployment automation tool, download and install the ZebClient CLI. For your convenience, the ZebClient CLI provides a simple deployment wizard.

* ZebClient uses AWS Access Key and Secret Key for the automated deployment and therefore, an existing AWS account is required. Please note that the AWS Access Key and the Secret Key are not stored by Zebware AB.

* Once the ZebClient cluster is ready to be used, a private SHH RSA Key for secure SSH access and an inventory list containing IP-addresses are created.

* As part of the deployment process, one single Application node is deployed per cluster. The ZebClient CLI makes it easy to scale out the ZebClient cluster to include additional application nodes to add extra performance when needed and to scale down to save cost.

* Networking is also managed by ZebClient CLI when installed in AWS Cloud.
