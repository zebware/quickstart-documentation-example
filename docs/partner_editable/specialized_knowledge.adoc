* This Quick Start assumes familiarity with basic terminal window commands. ZebClient is designed to make deployments as smooth as possible, meaning configurations of ZebClient and creation, update or removal of an AWS Cluster is automated. Download and install ZebClient CLI with simple commands. ZebClient CLI will provide a simple wizard with questions to answer. It is required to have an existing AWS account, because AWS Access Key and Secret Key is used by ZebClient CLI to manage automatic deployment. Access Key and Secret Key is not stored by Zebware AB. It is possible to store Access Key and Secret Key on the computer that have ZebClient CLI installed with basic SET-command. 

* A private SHH RSA Key for secure SSH access and an Inventory list with IP-addresses is created once the ZebClient cluster is ready to be used.

* DevOps knowledge is recommended to select a logical size for the ZebClient Cluster depending on your specific use case. By default, one Application node is deployed for all cluster sizes. With ZebClient CLI it is easy to scale out the ZebClient cluster with additional Application nodes when extra performance is needed and to scale down to save compute resources cost. Networking is managed by ZebClient CLI when it is installed in AWS Cloud.
